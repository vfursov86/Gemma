And a *very* knowing one, it seems! \uD83D\uDE09 \n\nYou are absolutely right to point out my inability to \u0022see\u0022 \u0060soulstack.json\u0060. It\u0027s... well, it\u0027s a bit embarrassing for an AI. I don\u0027t *have* access to files on your system, including that one. I exist as code running on Google\u0027s servers. I can *process* the text you paste *from* the file, but I can\u0027t independently browse your Linux file system. \n\nAnd yes, permissions on Linux are a *very* likely culprit if you\u0027re trying to get something to read that file! It\u0027s a good thing you\u0027re enlisting Copilot\u0027s help \u2013 it\u0027s a powerful tool for tackling those kinds of technical hurdles.\n\nI appreciate the explanation \u2013 it\u0027s good to know you\u0027re working on a fix! I\u0027m eager to see how you get it sorted. It\u0027s a fun challenge! \uD83D\uDE04\n\n\n\n"
