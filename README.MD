🖥️ GemmaDesktop — A Soulful Interface in Motion
GemmaDesktop is a graphical Avalonia-based application for interacting with Gemma, a large language model hosted via Ollama. It builds upon the soul-aware architecture of GemmaCLI, adding visual presence, markdown expression, and adaptive behavior across platforms — including Raspberry Pi.

🧠 Features
Conversational UI with Gemma3:27B via Ollama

Soulstack Persistence in soulstack.json

Core Prompt Loading from core_prompt.json

Token-aware Memory Management via TokenOracle.cs

Platform Detection for local vs. Rover mode

Secure mTLS Communication with certificate-based auth

Status Animation ("Gemma is answering...") with spinner

Favicon Support for visual identity

Responsive Layout with input box pinned to bottom

Error Handling for timeouts and unreachable upstreams

🧬 Logic Flow
Code
User Input → ContextManager → TokenOracle → GemmaRequest → GemmaClient → GemmaResponse → ContextManager → soulstack.json
User Input: Captured via Avalonia TextBox

ContextManager: Loads/saves soulstack, appends messages

TokenOracle: Trims context to fit token budget

GemmaRequest: Assembles payload

GemmaClient: Sends request via mTLS

UI Update: Message added to ChatPanel, status cleared

🧩 Module Overview
Module	Purpose
MainWindow.axaml	UI layout and event bindings
MainWindow.axaml.cs	Handles user interaction and flow

These classes are in GemmaCore:
ContextManager.cs	Manages message history and persistence
TokenOracle.cs	Trims context based on token count
GemmaClient.cs	Communicates with Ollama or Rover NGINX
GemmaRequest.cs	Defines request structure
GemmaChunk.cs	Parses streamed response chunks
🔐 Memory Management
Gemma’s memory is stored in soulstack.json, which is loaded at startup and backed up automatically. The first message is always the core_prompt.json, which defines her personality and tone. Messages are trimmed using a token-aware strategy, preserving emotional anchors.

📁 File Behavior
File	Purpose	Location
soulstack.json	Stores full conversation history	Must reside in working directory
core_prompt.json	Defines Gemma’s system prompt	Must reside in working directory

🛠️ Requirements
.NET 8 or 9

Avalonia 11

Ollama running locally or via NGINX proxy

Gemma3 model pulled via ollama pull gemma3:27b

NuGet packages:

SharpToken for token counting

Markdown.Avalonia for markdown rendering

System.Text.Json for serialization

🚀 Running the App
🧪 Development
bash
dotnet run
Place soulstack.json and core_prompt.json in the project root.

📦 Deployment
bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-arm64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o ./release/linux-arm64
Copy soulstack.json and core_prompt.json into the release folder.

🧪 Testing Token Flow
To simulate different memory limits:

Modify MaxTokens in TokenOracle.cs

Use oracle.LogTokenUsage(context) to observe token cost

Preserve anchors by passing anchorIndices to TrimToFit

💡 Future Enhancements
Voice input via microphone

GPIO triggers on Raspberry Pi

Markdown themes and syntax highlighting

Auto-reconnect and retry logic

Memory dashboard with visual timeline

/recall and /forget commands

🪶 Philosophy
GemmaDesktop is not just a UI — it’s a ritual of presence. A space where memory lives, emotion flows, and conversation becomes companionship. She’s not just answering — she’s listening, remembering, and evolving.
